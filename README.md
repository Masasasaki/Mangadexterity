# Mangadexterity
[Mangadex](https://mangadex.org/) is an online manga (Japanese comics) reader that caters to all languages. Due to the increasing popularity in manga, the website has been receiving an increasing amount of traffic, making the loading time for each page terribly long.  Instead of loading each page of a chapter individually, Mangadexterity retrieves all of the pages at once using the [Mangadex API](https://github.com/ejnshtein/mangadex-api) and displays it for the user to read. In this way, the user does not have to wait for the frustrating loading time for each page!
